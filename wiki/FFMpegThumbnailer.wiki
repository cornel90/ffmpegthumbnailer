#summary A lightweight video thumbnailer

= Introduction =

FFMpeg Thumbnailer is a lightweight video thumbnailer that can be used by file managers.
The thumbnailer is based on ffmpeg so it supports al the video formats that ffmpeg supports.

I finally looked at some problems I was still experiencing and managed to fix them.
Changelog:
  * Support for large files (files larger than 2Gb)
  * Seeking in h264 files is enabled again, use -w option from commandline to disable this if you have 100% cpu usage (using older versions of ffmpeg)
  * Give up reading packets from a file after a number of attempts to avoid a hanging ffmpegthumbnailer for certain file types (noticed on h264 and ac3 in vob container)

= Usage =
ffmpegthumbnailer is called from the command line

Available command line arguments:
  * -i: input video filename
  * -o: output filename of the generated image file (filename ending with .jpg or .jpeg will be in jpeg format, otherwise png is used)
  * -s: size of the generated thumbnail in pixels (optional, default value: 128)
  * -t: time to seek to in the movie (percentage) (optional, default: 10)
  * -f: use this option to overlay a movie strip on the generated thumbnail
  * -w: workaround some issues in older versions of ffmpeg (only use if you experience problems like 100% cpu usage on certain files)
  * -h: display the usage

To use ffmpegthumbnailer in combination with thunar, just install the thunar-thumbnailer packages from your distribution or from http://goodies.xfce.org/projects/thunar-plugins/thunar-thumbnailers. This will properly register ffmpegthumbnailer with thunar.
